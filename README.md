# nvimd

For new-age `neovim` users with an antiquated dev style:

- Open a terminal
- From the terminal, open a file with `vim`
- Edit the file, do dah doo
- Close `vim`, go back to terminal
- Open the next file in `vim`
- Rinse repeat

`nvimd` helps you do this with a long-running `neovim` server, so you don't
have to wait for the LSP to boot up each time.

This is easier than changing how I use `vim`, maybe one day I'll learn. ðŸ¤·

## Install

### `nvimd` and `nvimd-server`

#### Http

Manually download [`nvimd`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/nvimd/blob/main/nvimd)
and
[`nvimd-server`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/nvimd/blob/main/nvimd-server)
into your preferred `bin` location (e.g. `$HOME/.local/bin).

#### Git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ahdinosaur/nvimd
cd nvimd
./install.sh
```

This will install `nvimd` and `nvimd-server` to `$HOME/.local/bin` as symlinks
back to the `ahdinosaur/nvimd` git repo.

### Neovim config

Since `:q` will close the remote server, we need a special way to exit the
remote ui.

Add the following to your Lua `neovim` config

```lua
-- disconnect all remote-ui sessions
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>q", function()
  for _, ui in pairs(vim.api.nvim_list_uis()) do
    if ui.chan and not ui.stdout_tty then
      vim.fn.chanclose(ui.chan)
    end
  end
end, { noremap = true })
```

## Usage

When you start working on a project, in your project's root directory:

```shell
nvimd-server &
```

Then use `nvimd` as you would `nvim`:

```shell
nvimd path/to/file
```
