# nvimd

For new-age `neovim` users with an antiquated dev style:

- Open a terminal
- From the terminal, open a file with `vim`
- Edit the file, do dah doo
- Close `vim`, go back to terminal
- Open the next file in `vim`
- Rinse repeat

`nvimd` helps you do this with a long-running `neovim` server, so you don't
have to wait for the LSP to boot up each time.

This is easier than changing how I use `vim`, maybe one day I'll learn. ðŸ¤·

## Install

### `nvimd` and `nvimd-server`

#### Http

Manually download [`nvimd`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/nvimd/blob/main/nvimd)
and
[`nvimd-server`](https://github.com/ahdinosaur/nvimd/blob/main/nvimd-server)
into your preferred `bin` location (e.g. `$HOME/.local/bin`).

#### Git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ahdinosaur/nvimd
cd nvimd
./install.sh
```

This will install `nvimd` and `nvimd-server` to `$HOME/.local/bin` as symlinks
back to the `ahdinosaur/nvimd` git repo.

### Neovim config

Since `:q` will close the remote server, we need a special way to exit the
remote ui.

Add the following to your Lua `neovim` config

```lua
-- disconnect all remote-ui sessions
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>q", function()
  for _, ui in pairs(vim.api.nvim_list_uis()) do
    if ui.chan and not ui.stdout_tty then
      vim.fn.chanclose(ui.chan)
    end
  end
end, { noremap = true })
```

## Usage

When you start working on a project, in your project's root directory:

```shell
nvimd-server &
```

Then use `nvimd` as you would `nvim`:

```shell
nvimd path/to/file
```

When you want to close your editor, use your special keymap (`<leader>q`)
instead of `:q`.

## FAQ

### Why?

Yes.

### How does this work?

We use the output of `tty` and `pwd` to construct a socket path.

Because [`neovim`'s server is not multi-tenant](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2161),
we need a separate server for each terminal (`tty`).

Also for the sake of plugins working as expected, we want a separate
server for each working directory (`pwd`)

When you run `nvimd-server`:

- Start a `nvim` server with the given socket path.
- In case this `nvim` server is shut down, restart in an infinite loop.
- If we get a signal to close this program, clean up the socket before exiting.

We need to start `nvimd-server &` in the terminal separately, so the terminal
is the parent, and when the terminal is closed, the server is closed.

When you run `nvimd`:

- Check if there is the socket exists
- If so, connect to the `nvim` server as a remote ui
- Otherwise, run `nvim` as usual

### Why does `nvimd-server` need to be started separately?

I was hoping `nvimd` could be used as a drop-in replacement for `nvim`.

If `nvimd-server` wasn't yet running, then run it when you call `nvimd` the
first time.

But I couldn't solve this issue:

- If `nvimd` starts `nvimd-server`, then `nvimd-server`'s parent process is
  `nvimd`.
- When that `nvimd` process eventually stops (because you're done editing your
  file), then `nvimd-server` has no parent and is re-parented to PID 1 (`init`).
- When you later are done and close your terminal, `nvimd-server` keeps running.

I think a proper solution would be something
